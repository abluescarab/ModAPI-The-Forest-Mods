## FAQ
### What's the difference between Invincible and God Mode?
The Invincible cheat keeps you from dying: anything that would normally kill you, like starvation, falling off high cliffs, or getting in fights with mutants won't anymore.

God Mode includes invincibility and a whole bunch of other stuff--you will never get infected, never get cold, never run out of stamina or energy, and never have to eat or drink.

These cheats cannot be enabled at the same time. Use one or the other.

### What's the difference between No Clip and Fly Mode?
Fly Mode is just that--it allows you to fly. No Clip allows you to "clip" through objects, meaning that you can walk right through them. Turn both on if you want to be able to fly AND pass through objects.

### My unlimited flashlight cheat isn't working or isn't turning off!
You have to put your flashlight away and bring it out again to see changes when you turn the cheat on or off.
